// Angular-Material2 uses a utility scss file, styles.scss, which like theme.scss is located in /src and automatically compiles. By simply importing the theme.scss into styles.scss you can tap into the color mixins...I think we can tap into other mixins as well to update some of the component styles to match our custom preferences...
